# Privacy Considerations

This API is designed to empower users with visibility into their own streaming usage while preserving privacy. Key principles:

## User-Centric Access
Only authenticated users can access their own data. No third-party access is permitted without explicit consent.

## Minimal Exposure
The API avoids exposing personal identifiers such as name, email, or billing details. Session data is scoped to viewing activity only.

## Granular Scopes
OAuth scopes are narrowly defined:
- `usage.read`: Access to viewing history and session metadata
- `profile.read`: Access to profile-level summaries

## Anonymization Support
Providers may optionally support pseudonymous identifiers and region-level aggregation to further reduce exposure.

## No Behavioral Profiling
This API does not support predictive analytics, recommendation modeling, or behavioral tracking. It is strictly retrospective and user-controlled.
