# Unified Streaming Usage API (RFC)

This repository proposes an open standard for accessing personal streaming usage data across platforms like Netflix, Stan, Prime Video, Disney+, and Binge.

## 🚨 Problem

Streaming platforms offer little to no visibility into how users engage with their content. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to:

- Understand personal viewing habits
- Make informed decisions about subscriptions
- Audit screen time across households
- Build third-party dashboards or parental tools

## 🎯 Goal

To define a standardized, privacy-respecting API that allows users to retrieve their own viewing history, session metadata, and content engagement metrics—regardless of provider.
